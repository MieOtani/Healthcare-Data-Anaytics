# ðŸ“Š Healthcare-Data-Anaytics

Explored the correlation between life expectancy, GDP, and COVID-19 mortality across 20 countries using datasets from the UN, Kaggle, and World Bank. Cleaned data in Excel, analyzed in MySQL, and visualized findings in Tableau through an interactive dashboard.

ðŸ§  Overview
This project analyzes healthcare-related data from global sources to investigate:
- How GDP per capita relates to life expectancy
- Whether thereâ€™s a connection between economic indicators and COVID-19 mortality
- Patterns and outliers in different regions of the world

I used Excel, MySQL, and Tableau to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

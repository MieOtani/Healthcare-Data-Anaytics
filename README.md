# 📊 Healthcare-Data-Anaytics

Explored the correlation between life expectancy, GDP, and COVID-19 mortality across 20 countries using datasets from the UN, Kaggle, and World Bank. Cleaned data in Excel, analyzed in MySQL, and visualized findings in Tableau through an interactive dashboard.

# 🧠 Overview
This project analyzes healthcare-related data from global sources to investigate:
- How GDP per capita relates to life expectancy
- Whether there’s a connection between economic indicators and COVID-19 mortality
- Patterns and outliers in different regions of the world

I used Excel, MySQL, and Tableau to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

# 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- MySQL – Data storage and advanced querying
- Tableau – Dashboards and visual storytelling

# 📂 Files Included

# 📎 Key Insights
- Higher GDP does not always correlate with better COVID outcomes
- Some lower-income countries had surprisingly high life expectancies
- Regions with more healthcare investment tended to show resilience during the pandemic

# 📌 Notes
- All dataset sources were publicly available
- Data covers global figures from 2020–2021
